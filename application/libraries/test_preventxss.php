/**
 * RULE #1 - HTML Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Element Content
 *
 * Escape the following characters with HTML entity encoding to prevent switching into
 * any execution context, such as script, style, or event handlers. Using hex entities is
 * recommended in the spec. In addition to the 5 characters significant in XML (&, <, >, ", '), the
 * forward slash is included as it helps to end an HTML entity.
 *
 * & --> &amp;
 * < --> &lt;
 * > --> &gt;
 * " --> &quot;
 * ' --> &#x27;     &apos; not recommended because its not in the HTML spec
 * / --> &#x2F;     forward slash is included as it helps end an HTML entity

	 * RULE #2 - Attribute Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Common Attributes
	 *
	 * For putting untrusted data into typical attribute values like width, name, value, etc.
	 * This should not be used for complex attributes like href, src, style, or any of the event
	 * handlers like onmouseover. (Use URL and JavaScript encode).
	 *
	 * Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with
	 * the &#xHH; format (or a named entity if available) to prevent switching out of the attribute.

	 * RULE #3 - JavaScript Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into JavaScript Data Values
	 *
	 * For dynamically generated JavaScript code - both script blocks and event-handler attributes.
	 * The only safe place to put untrusted data into this code is inside a quoted "data value."
	 *
	 * Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters less than 256 with the \xHH format
	 * to prevent switching out of the data value into the script context or into another attribute.
	 * DO NOT use any escaping shortcuts like \" because the quote character may be matched by the
	 * HTML attribute parser which runs first. These escaping shortcuts are also susceptible to
	 * "escape-the-escape" attacks where the attacker sends \" and the vulnerable code turns that
	 * into \\" which enables the quote.

	 * RULE #4 - CSS Escape And Strictly Validate Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Style Property Values
	 *
	 * When you want to put untrusted data into a stylesheet or a style tag. CSS is surprisingly powerful,
	 * and can be used for numerous attacks. Therefore, it's important that you only use untrusted data in a
	 * property value and not into other places in style data.
	 *
	 * Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with
	 * the \HH escaping format. DO NOT use any escaping shortcuts like \" because the quote character may be
	 * matched by the HTML attribute parser which runs first. These escaping shortcuts are also susceptible
	 * to "escape-the-escape" attacks where the attacker sends \" and the vulnerable code turns that into \\" which

	/**
	 * RULE #5 - URL Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML URL Parameter Values
	 *
	 * When you want to put untrusted data into HTTP GET parameter value.
	 *
	 * Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with
	 * the %HH escaping format. Including untrusted data in data: URLs should not be allowed as there is no
	 * good way to disable attacks with escaping to prevent switching out of the URL. All attributes should
	 * be quoted. Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters
	 * including [space] % * + , - / ; < = > ^ and |. Note that entity encoding is useless in this context.
	 *
	 * WARNING: Do not encode complete or relative URL's with this encoding! If untrusted input is meant to
	 * be placed into href, src or other URL-based attributes, it should be validated to make sure it does
	 * not point to an unexpected protocol, especially Javascript links. URL's should then be encoded based
	 * on the context of display like any other piece of data. For example, user driven URL's in HREF links
	 * should be attribute encoded (Rule #2).
