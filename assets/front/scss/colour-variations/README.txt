The colour variations in this directory load on top of the default primary colour and override existing colour definitions within the theme-style.css file.

This is mainly for demo purposes or for users not comfortable with using Sass.
If you are comfortable with using Sass itâ€™s recommended you override the $primary_colour variables in the core/_appstrap_variables.scss file & recompile the sass files instead.
