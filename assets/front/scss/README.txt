SCSS DIRECTORY (/scss)
----------------------------

This directory contains the sass source files which can be compiled into css code.

All files with an underscore (_SOMETHING) and in subfolders are include files which are pulled into the main .scss files when they are compiled.

To compile Sass files you will need to install gulp which is a task runner and command line tool. See the /documentation/README.txt for more information on using sass.
